        "abstract": "Microgrids are revolutionary power systems that interconnect a mix of renewable power generation, load, storage systems, and inverters in a small-scale grid network. Operating microgrids while maintaining a consistent grid voltage and frequency during the islanding and disruption of renewables has been a challenging research problem. In this paper, a preliminary microgrid agent implementation is presented using SPADE (Smart Python Agent Development Environment) as a powerful development framework that has been used extensively in many application domains. Agents autonomously managed and operated microgrid individual components. A multiagent microgrid system was modeled to seamlessly operate and optimize energy balance by coordinating the actions of agents. Agents were built to forecast energy demand and solar power and coordinate to balance generation with load while maintaining optimal power flow and adequate network voltage and frequency.",

        "abstract": "The current electrification status in West African countries presents rural electrification rates below 40\\%, national grid losses above 39\\% with frequent disruptions, and electricity prices averaging \\$0.35/kWh, up to national values of \\$0.66/kWh. With this, off-grid systems have gained great attention during the last decade as energy solutions; especially solar home systems (SHS) and mini grids. Nowadays, 385 mini grids with a power of near 30 MW are operating in West Africa, with 95\\% based on PV. Since 2019, result-based tenders with international aid funding\u2014more effective than previous competitive tenders\u2014seek to install at least 317 new mini grids in Togo, 250 in Nigeria, 100 in Burkina Faso, and two in Mali. Besides, the market for mini-grid energy access start-ups grew from \\$19 million in 2013 to \\$339 million in 2018. Despite this recent development in West Africa, research and data for mini grids in this region is scarce, and it is mostly approached from the technological side, with a striking lack of information regarding the social impact. This work tries to describe the present status of research and current operating installations, as well as the main challenges for future development of off grid mini grids in West Africa, which pose as the missing link between SHS and grid extension.",

        "abstract": "Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is home to 75\\% of the world\u2019s unelectrified population, and approximately 500 million of these live in rural areas. Off-grid mini-grids are being deployed on a large scale to address the region\u2019s electrification inequalities. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review of the research on the off-grid renewable mini-grids in SSA. The study covers the current status of the level of deployment of off-grid mini-grids. It also reviews multi-criteria decision-making models for optimizing engineering, economics, and management interests in mini-grid siting and design in SSA. The statuses of financing, policy, and tariffs for mini-grids in SSA are also studied. Finally, the current status of energy justice research in respect of mini-grids in SSA is reviewed. The study shows the important role of decentralized renewable technologies in the electrification of SSA\u2019s rural population. Within a decade since 2010, the rural electrification rate of SSA has increased from 17\\% to 28\\%, and 11 million mini-grid connections are currently operational. Despite these gains, the literature points to several injustices related to the present model by which SSA\u2019s renewable mini-grids are funded, deployed, and operated. Hence, several recommendations are provided for the effective application of the energy justice framework (EJF) for just and equitable mini-grids in SSA.",

        "abstract": "The growing frequency of power outages has prompted increased interest in developing a more resilient power grid that can quickly recover from weather-related damage. At the distribution level, power restoration is a complex, multi-stage process involving multiple response entities. Providing utility stakeholders, government regulators, and the public with information about outage duration and estimated time to restoration is crucial. The research employs a multi-agent simulation approach, which allows for the simulation of decision-making behaviors among different entities and the incorporation of various uncertainties. Specifically, the study uses the open-source simulation package Mesa-Geo in conjunction with the Python language and constructs a road network using the open-source network extension pgRouting for routing queries. The research design includes several experiments focused on Florida as a case study, comparing repair crew sizes, power outage numbers, and road damage scenarios. The findings could offer valuable managerial guidance on resource allocation in the restoration process.",

        "abstract": "The growing population and technological developments have led to irregular houses and especially industrial facilities in developing cities. Furthermore, due to social and economic factors and the increasing massive migrations, undeveloped rural projects make irregular settlements worse. Thus, the expensiveness caused by the deterioration of the supply-demand balance makes establishment or production capacity increase of industrial facilities difficult. In this study, supplying the industrial urban facilities\u2019 demand with only grid or on-grid/offgrid HPS scenarios were investigated considering expanding and relocation outside the city. Twelve industrial cities in Turkey with various climates have been evaluated using Homer \u00ae Pro, considering the effects of RES potential on the techno-economic parameters. The results showed that the RES potentials changed break-even distance for grid extension between 0 and 25 km. Furthermore, it has been determined that the change in the discount rate and the grid extension costs, which vary depending on the regional geographical conditions, seriously manipulate break-even distance. Particularly, it can be extended up to 55 km depending on RES potentials and grid extension capital cost. In contrast, high RES potential make unnecessary grid extension, especially where the discount rate was less than 4\\%. Finally, sensitivity analyses are also presented in detail.",

        "abstract": "In an energy community, the prosumers\u2019 interactions are critical to ensure efficient use of renewable resources. Local energy sharing concepts where a coordinating agent typically regulates the energy transactions between prosumers intend to achieve such a sharing economy. The coordinating agent, known as the market agent or energy sharing agent, acts according to a set of rules to match the prosumers\u2019 renewable energy surpluses and deficits. This paper describes an agent-based modeling strategy and a case study to demonstrate the interactions in an energy sharing community where each agent individually and collectively attempts to maximize renewable energy self-consumption. The prosumers attempt to achieve their individual and collective objectives by following a two-step rule-based strategy. In the first step, a building-integrated battery storage operation strategy based on a schedule improves the prosumer-level self-consumption while providing grid-friendly behavior. The next step involves an energy sharing strategy and an operating strategy for community-scale battery storage that maximizes the collective selfconsumption. Throughout the transactions, prosumers have no visibility of other prosumers; therefore, the energy sharing coordinator has the sole responsibility of orchestrating the energy exchanges between prosumers. Finally, we discuss the significance and future research outlook for energy interaction modeling at a community scale.",

        "abstract": "The shift towards renewable energy sources (RES) in energy systems is becoming increasingly important. Residential energy generation and storage assets, smart home energy management systems, and peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity trading in microgrids can help integrate and balance decentralized renewable electricity supply with an increasingly electrified power, heat, and transport demand, reducing costs and CO2 emissions. However, these microgrids are difficult to model because they consist of autonomous and interacting entities, leading to emergent phenomena and a high degree of complexity. Agent-based modeling is an established technique to simulate the complexity of microgrids. However, the existing literature still lacks real-world implementation studies and, as a first step, models capable of validating the existing results with real-world data. To this end, we present an agent-based model and analyze the corresponding microgrid performance with real-world data. The model quantifies economic, technical, and environmental metrics to simulate microgrid performance holistically and, in line with state-of-the-art research, consists of self-interested, autonomous agents with specific load profiles, RES generation, and demand-response potential. The model can simulate a P2P marketplace where electricity is traded between agents. In the second part of the paper, we validate the model with data from a medium-sized German city. In this case study, we also compare microgrid performance in 2022, during the energy market crisis in Europe, with historical data from 2019 to assess the effects of energy market shocks. Our results show how microgrids with P2P trading can reduce electricity costs and CO2 emissions. However, our trading mechanism illustrates that the benefits of energy-community trading are almost exclusively shared among prosumers, highlighting the need to consider distributional issues when implementing P2P trading.",

        "abstract": "Nearly 840 million people still lack access to electricity, while over a billion more have an unreliable electricity connection. In this article, the three different electrification pathways\u2014grid extension, centralized microgrids, and standalone solar-based solutions, such as pico-solar and solar home systems (SHS)\u2014are critically examined while understanding their relative merits and demerits. Grid extension can provide broad scale access at low levelized costs but requires a certain electricity demand threshold and population density to justify investments. To a lesser extent, centralized (off-grid) microgrids also require a minimum demand threshold and knowledge of the electricity demand. Solar-based solutions are the main focus in terms of off-grid electrification in this article, given the equatorial/tropical latitudes of the un(der-)electrified regions. In recent times, decentralized solar-based off-grid solutions, such as pico-solar and SHS, have shown the highest adoption rates and promising impetus with respect to basic lighting and electricity for powering small appliances. However, the burning question is\u2014from lighting a million to empowering a billion\u2014can solar home systems get us there?The two main roadblocks for SHS are discussed, and the requirements from the ideal electrification pathway are introduced. A bottom-up, interconnected SHS-based electrification pathway is proposed as the missing link among the present electrification pathways.",

        "abstract": "Recently, numerous data-driven approaches to control an electric grid using machine learning techniques have been investigated. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based techniques provide a credible alternative to conventional, optimization-based solvers especially when there is uncertainty in the environment, such as renewable generation or cyber system performance. Efficiently training an agent, however, requires numerous interactions with an environment to learn the best policies. There are numerous RL environments for power systems, and, similarly, there are environments for communication systems. Most cyber system simulators are based in a UNIX environment, while the power system simulators are based in the Windows operating system. Hence the generation of a cyber-physical, mixed-domain RL environment has been challenging. Existing co-simulation methods are efficient, but are resource and time intensive to generate large-scale data sets for training RL agents. Hence, this work focuses on the development and validation of a mixed-domain RL environment using OpenDSS for the power system and leveraging a discrete event simulator Python package, SimPy for the cyber system, which is operating system agnostic. Further, we present the results of co-simulation and training RL agents for a cyber-physical network reconfiguration and Volt-Var control problem in a power distribution feeder.",
